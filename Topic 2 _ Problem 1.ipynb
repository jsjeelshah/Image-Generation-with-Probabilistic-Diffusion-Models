We have gone through all the topics and tried to understand the requirements and output generation. We concluded that topic 2: Image generation with a probabilistic Diffusion Model is very intriguing and would like to proceed further as our final term project. We have gone through the videos shared, reference paper, and code and done our research around Deniousing Diffusion Probabilistic Models on the internet which was aligned with the work we would like to have our technical expertise developed with this project. The key concept in Diffusion Modelling is that if we could build a learning model which can learn the systematic decay of information due to noise, then it should be possible to reverse the process and therefore, recover the information back from the noise."],"metadata":{"id":"t5zt9Lbc0JKQ"}}]}
